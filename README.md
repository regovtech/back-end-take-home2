# { "developer": "Back-end" }

Hey! We are excited that you are interested in joining the team at Regov Technologies.

We feel that the best place to really show us your skills is somewhere you feel comfortable. This test should not take you a long amount of time to complete.

This take home test is used to determine how you go about solving problems logically, as well as building out easy to use, API End points. This test is open to interpretation and implementation.

### Coding Challenge

Build API for users to search Git. A system administrator can access reports of keywords searched users.

Develop a backend app that exposes APIs for user registration and search github repository and projects:


1. Add User
2. Search git repository or projects
3. Fetch User based reports 
4. Fetch Keyword based reports

### User Stories (Requirements)

- As a user I can register.
- As an admin I can approve registration, reject, suspend, and delete users.
- As a user I can login in only after approval get list of repositories or projects based on my search type and keyword:
  - Access list of Git repositories
- As a user I can logout from the system
- As an admin I can retrieve daily, weekly and monthly reports of users with a list of keywords searched.
- As an admin I can retrieve daily, weekly and monthly reports based on keywords searched.

Feel free to go above and beyond if you have ideas for extra features!

### Notes and recommendations 

- Use Node.js | Python.
- Use Git API V3 or above.
- Dockerise the application
- The languages, frameworks and libraries mentioned are recommendations only, you are free to use whatever you are comfortable with.
- The project structure is up to your decision.
- You are recommended to use git commits in a logical manner to demonstrate the development progress
- Writing tests and adhering to development standards/conventions will attract extra points.
- Writing design documents will attract extra points :)

### The HandOver

- Send your implementation in Git Repo.

### The Review

Please include a README file with a quick description of your solution, the thought process, and any points you'd like to highlight. It will help us during the review, where we'll look at:

- VCS history
- the project structure,
- the project architecture,
- coding practices,
- consistent coding style and formatting,
- namings and naming conventions,
- good use of comments,
- lint warnings and code smells
- unit & integration tests
