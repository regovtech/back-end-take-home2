# Welcome to our PopQuiz!
# { "developer": "Backend" }

Hey! We are excited that you are interested in joining the team at Regov Technologies.

We feel that the best way for you to produce your best codes is when you hit flow in your comfort zone. Therefore, this is a pop-quiz for you to complete. This test should not take you a long amount of time to complete.

Demonstrate your problem solving skills and understanding of core data structures by attempting both questions. The questions are open to interpretation and implementation.

### Coding Challenge

## Question 1
Build API for users to search Git. A system administrator can access reports of keywords searched users.

Develop a backend app that exposes APIs for user registration and search github repository and projects:

1. Add User
2. Search git repository or projects
3. Fetch User based reports 
4. Fetch Keyword based reports

### User Stories (Requirements)

- As a user I can register.
- As an admin I can approve registration, reject, suspend, and delete users.
- As a user I can login in only after approval get list of repositories or projects based on my search type and keyword:
  - Access list of Git repositories
- As a user I can logout from the system
- As an admin I can retrieve daily, weekly and monthly reports of users with a list of keywords searched.
- As an admin I can retrieve daily, weekly and monthly reports based on keywords searched.
- As a system stakeholder I can view the use case or class diagram of the system architecture

Feel free to go above and beyond if you have ideas for extra features!

## Question 2 - Data structures:

### Exercise 1: Implement a stack using an array

Implement a stack data structure using an array in Python. Your implementation should have the following methods:

push(value): adds an element to the top of the stack
pop(): removes and returns the top element from the stack
peek(): returns the top element of the stack without removing it
is_empty(): returns True if the stack is empty, False otherwise


### Exercise 2: Hash Table

Implement a hash table data structure using a list in Python. Your implementation should have the following methods:

insert(key, value): inserts a key-value pair into the hash table
get(key): returns the value associated with the given key in the hash table, or None if the key is not in the hash table
delete(key): removes the key-value pair associated with the given key from the hash table


### Notes

- Use Node.js | Python
- Use Git API V3 or above
- Dockerise the application
- Apply your preferred coding structure
- Unit test is an added advantage
- Add README
- Produce use case or class diagram for the system architecture 
- Writing design documents will attract extra points :)

### Submission

1. Your code should be made available in a public or private repository, on your personal github or bitbucket;
2. Push up to your repo one last time
3. Email techchallenge@regovtech.com with the link to your repository
